        "Multilayer Perceptrons have grown to be powerful feed forward neural networks made of fully connected layers that are stacked on top of each other. These layers begin with an input layer, end with an output layer and have at least one hidden layer in between. Often times, with these powerful models, interpretability goes out the window and the model user often has no idea what is happening behind the scenes of these predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook I try to demystify the black box to improve explainability and interpretability of these types of models. I use a very simple use case and model below to start by explaining a simpler, smaller example that can then be extrapolated to understand more complex models as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example below, my MLP has one input, only one hidden layer and one output layer, keeping it simple. Next, my MLPs objective is to use one-hot-encoded strings and produce them in reverse order. I use synthetic data to fit this model with the simple use case of reversing strings of length three with from vocab size of three.\n",
        "\n",
        "To better understand what Multilayer Perceptrons were, how to understand the hidden layers and activation functions and also develop the scripts and fine tune them, I often used ChatGPT 5.1.

        "In the heatmap above, the darker greens represent large differences in activations while the lighter and white greens represent smaller differences. A similar trend to what we saw earlier holds true here as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "The strongest pattern, is the consistency in the small differences. Neurons 0, 1, 5, 6 and 9 continued to show small to moderate differences, reinforcing the idea that these represent the first or last letters, the encoding \"a\" or the symmetry as these are all consistent amongst the inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the largest differences still come from Neurons 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8. These neurons capture some of the nuance in the second letter. Neuron 5 is largely different in `aaa` than the other two inputs - perhaps this neuron captures cases were all the letters are the same.\n",

I understand now that there are three main functions of a neuron (1) local feature detectors that respond to a specific position or character of the input, (2) global pattern indicators like symmetry and (3) irrelevant or silent neurons that encodes irrelevant features to the input. <br> <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "***What was confusing, surprising, or challenging to interpret?*** <br>\n",
        "Because I only used three key inputs, it was difficult to interpret the specifics of which neuron corresponded to which pattern recognition and how this was getting encoded. I understand holistically how the neurons work and what types of signals they could send, but the specific interpretability of exact functions of each neuron is difficult to isolate. <br> <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "***What’s one thing I wish I could understand better or explore further?***\n",
        "Neuron 6 was fascinating to me because it kept capturing an irrelevant feature for all of my inputs. I'm really intrigued to know what is consistently encoding since there are many aspects to all three inputs that are consistent."
